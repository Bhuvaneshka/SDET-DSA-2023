//	You are given an integer n, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:
//
//		If the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. A total of n / 2 matches are played, 
//		and n / 2 teams advance to the next round.
//		If the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, 
//		and the rest gets paired. A total of (n - 1) / 2 matches are played, and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to the next round.

//		Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.
