public class IsSubsequenceLeetCode392 {
//	Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
//	A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 
//	(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
	
	// Points to Check:
				// 1) Did you understand the problem? - Yes
				// 2) Test data Set - 
				// 3) Do I know how to solve it? - 
				// 4) Ask for Hint? - 
				// 5) Do I know alternate solution as well? - 
				// 6) Find out the Big O Notation? - 
				// 7) Start always with pseudo code - 
				// 8) Implement the code in Editor, - 
				// 9) Test different set of data - 
				// 10) If it fails, debug them to solve it!! -
