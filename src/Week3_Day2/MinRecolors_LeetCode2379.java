public class MinRecolors_LeetCode2379 {
//	You are given a 0-indexed string blocks of length n, where blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B', representing the color of the ith block. 
//	The characters 'W' and 'B' denote the colors white and black, respectively.
//	You are also given an integer k, which is the desired number of consecutive black blocks.
//	In one operation, you can recolor a white block such that it becomes a black block.
//	Return the minimum number of operations needed such that there is at least one occurrence of k consecutive black blocks.
	
	// Points to Check:
			// 1) Did you understand the problem? - Yes
			// 2) Test data Set - 
			// 3) Do I know how to solve it? - 
			// 4) Ask for Hint? - 
			// 5) Do I know alternate solution as well? - 
			// 6) Find out the Big O Notation? - 
			// 7) Start always with pseudo code - 
			// 8) Implement the code in Editor, - 
			// 9) Test different set of data - 
			// 10) If it fails, debug them to solve it!! - 
	
//	Time Complexity:
//	Space Complexity:
	
//	Pseudo Code:
//	1) Iterate the loop and check for first two elements using sliding algorithm
//	2) Count the operation that how many operation needs to be performed to get the desired output, 
//		if both values are same count as 0, else count the no of operation to be performed
//	3) then move to the next slide which is i-1 & j+1, i denotes the left pointer & j denotes the right pointer
//	4) Repeat the comparition until arr1.length
//	5) Find the least count which the opration need to be performed
